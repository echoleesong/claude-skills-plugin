## 🚀 Installation

### Understanding Skills Priority

Claude Code Skills are loaded with different priorities (highest to lowest):

| Priority | Level | Location | Scope |
|:--------:|:------|:---------|:------|
| **1** (Highest) | Enterprise | Managed settings | Organization-wide |
| **2** | Personal | `~/.claude/skills/` | All your projects |
| **3** | Project | `.claude/skills/` | Current project |
| **4** (Lowest) | Plugin | Plugin `skills/` directory | Plugin users |

**We recommend Method 1** for the best experience, as it gives your Skills the highest non-enterprise priority.

---

### ⭐ Method 1: Personal Skills Directory (Recommended)

Install directly to your personal skills folder for **highest priority**:

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Clone to personal skills repository directory
git clone https://github.com/echoleesong/claude-skills-plugin.git ~/.claude/skills-repo

# Run automatic install script (creates symlinks)
cd ~/.claude/skills-repo && ./install.sh
```

#### Windows (PowerShell, requires Administrator)

```powershell
# Clone to personal skills repository directory
git clone https://github.com/echoleesong/claude-skills-plugin.git "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills-repo"

# Run automatic install script (requires Administrator for symlinks)
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills-repo"
.\install.ps1
```

#### Update Skills

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cd ~/.claude/skills-repo && git pull && ./install.sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills-repo"; git pull; .\install.ps1
```

#### 🔄 Setup Auto-Sync (Optional)

Automatically sync new skills after `git pull`:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
cd ~/.claude/skills-repo && ./setup-hooks.sh

# After setup, git pull will automatically run install.sh
```

✅ **Advantages**: Highest priority (Personal level), takes precedence over all plugins, easy to update with `git pull`, supports auto-sync.

<details>
<summary>📌 Manual Installation (without scripts)</summary>

If you prefer not to use the install scripts, you can manually create symlinks:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && \
ln -sf ~/.claude/skills-repo/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"
Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills-repo\skills" -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\$($_.Name)" -Target $_.FullName
}
```

</details>

---

### Method 2: Plugin Marketplace (Standard)

Install as a plugin via Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add echoleesong/claude-skills-plugin

# Install the plugin
/plugin install claude-skills-plugin@echoleesong-claude-skills-plugin
```

⚠️ **Note**: Plugin Skills have the **lowest priority**. If you need higher priority, use Method 1 or upgrade after installation:

<details>
<summary>📌 Upgrade Plugin to Personal Priority</summary>

```bash
# macOS / Linux: Link plugin skills to personal directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && \
ln -sf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-skills-plugin-marketplace/claude-skills-plugin/*/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"
$pluginPath = Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\plugins\cache\claude-skills-plugin-marketplace\claude-skills-plugin\*\skills" | Select-Object -First 1
Get-ChildItem $pluginPath -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\$($_.Name)" -Target $_.FullName
}
```

</details>

---

### Method 3: Project-Level Installation

Install for a specific project only:

```bash
# In your project directory
git clone https://github.com/echoleesong/claude-skills-plugin.git .claude/skills-repo

# Link skills to project directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills && \
ln -sf .claude/skills-repo/skills/* .claude/skills/
```

✅ **Use case**: When you only need these skills for a specific project.
